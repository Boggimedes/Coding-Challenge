# Coding-Challenge
Novel (/Brazen) approach to a coding challenge

Hi, welcome to my coding challenge.  Over the last few years of job applying I've done over a dozen different coding challenges, and didn't get any of the jobs.  However, these are extremly simple coding exercises so it is not a judge of skill, it is a judge of whether I "Naturally" code in whatever style-guide/pattern you use at your company.  The problem I have with this is that guide/pattern is not provided, and every style guide and pattern is opinionated.  This is no "RIGHT" pattern just like there is rarely ONE way to solve a coding problem.  So, did I have too much inline documentation, or too little?  Did I make my variable names too long and descriptive, or too short and efficient?  Do I use brackets when an if statement is just a "return;"?  This is perhaps the least critical skill for a developer to have since, if provided with a sufficient style guide and patterns, this is positively trivial to follow.  I propose you assume I'm capable of following a style guide and we move forward.  If you instead insist on this antiquated and awful hiring practice, then please feel free to move on to the next candidate.
